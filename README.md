# python-login

Welcome !

Here you can find the project named python-login,
python-login simulates the login to the computer.

To run this program, you need to install Python 3 (Python 2 doesn't work)

I am working on a graphical interface but for the moment the program doesn't have one.
Do not hesitate to give me advice to improve myself.
(I'm new to GitHub)

Thanks !
